0,Price ($),Current price per unit of Ethereum in USD,FALSE,-
1,Circulating Supply,The total number of mined ETH circulating on the Ethereum network,FALSE,-
2,Market Capitalisation,The market value of all coins in the network. It is calculated by taking the product of Circulating supply & Ethereum's current price,TRUE,$Market$ $Capitalisation = Circulating$ $Supply$ x $Price_{curr} (USD)$
3,Transaction Count,The total number of confirmed on-chain transactions.,FALSE,-
4,Transaction Count by Value,The total number of confirmed on-chain transactions by value.,TRUE,-
5,Average Block Size,The average Ethereum block size in kilobytes,FALSE,-
6,Average Gas Used,The average gas used per block in a day on the Ethereum network.,FALSE,-
7,Average Gas Limit,The average gas limit on Ethereum,FALSE,-
8,Average Transaction Fee (USD),The average mining fee per transaction in USD,FALSE,-
9,Average Transaction Value (USD),The fraction of total transaction value over the total number of transactions for each day,FALSE,-
10,Blocks Mined,The number of blocks generated in a day on the Ethereum network.,TRUE,-
11,Transaction Volume (USD),The volume of USD transacted on Ethereum blockchain in USD.,FALSE,-
12,Average Block Interval (s),The average time between blocks generated in seconds.,FALSE,-
13,Average Gas Price (Gwei),The average gas price per transaction.,FALSE,-
14,Number of New Contracts,The number of newly created contracts in the network.,FALSE,-
15,Active Addresses,"The total number of unique active addresses, inclusive of senders and receivers.",TRUE,-
16,Active Sending Addresses,The number of addresses that were active as a sender.,TRUE,-
17,Active Receiving Addresses,The number of addresses that were active as a receiver.,TRUE,-
18,Network Value to Transaction (NVT),"NVT represents the ratio between Market Capitalisation and transferred volume. An upward trend will indicate that the coin pricing is at a premium, whereby Market Capitalisation is growing at a pace greater than that of transferred volume. A downward trend will indicate that the coin pricing is at a discount, whereby Market Capitalisation is growing at a pace smaller than that of transferred volume. A constant trend will mean that both Market Capitalisation and transferred volume are in equlibrium.",TRUE,$NVT$ $ratio$ = $Market Capitalisation \over Transaction Volume (USD)$
19,Velocity,Measure of how quickly units are circulating in the network. It is also the inverse of NVT ratio.,TRUE,$Velocity$ = $1 \over NVT$ = $Transaction Volume (USD) \over Market Capitalisation$
20,ERC-20 Transfers,The amount of ERC-20 transfers on the Ethereum network.,FALSE,-
